Greetings curious visitor! I'm David Chang and I'm currently the Backend Team Lead at <a href="https://chefsplate.com" target="_blank">Chefs Plate</a>, a meal kit subscription service currently delivering coast-to-coast in Canada.   

On my spare time, I'm also an editor for the [Gaardian](http://www.gaardian.com), a satirical newspaper for the [Aardwolf MUD](http://www.aardwolf.com) community. You can find me by the name `Mandorallen`.

During my spare time, I can be found tinkering on a [side project](/projects) or giving [meet-up talks](https://speakerdeck.com/davidchchang) to the development community.

Feel free to ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/davidchchang) or [GitHub](https://github.com/davidchchang) if you have a question! 

Thanks for dropping by!
