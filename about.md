Greetings curious visitor! I'm David and I'm currently the Backend Team Lead at [Chefs Plate](https://chefsplate.com), a meal kit subscription service currently delivering coast-to-coast in Canada. I was previously a Lead Engineer at [Nascent Digital](http://nascentdigital.com/), a mobile development agency, where I was helping build out the new [TELUS My Account](https://www.telus.com/my-account/) experience.   

On my spare time, I can be found tinkering on a [side project](/projects), giving [meet-up talks](https://speakerdeck.com/davidchchang) to the development community (currently an organizer of the [Laravel Toronto meet-up group](https://www.meetup.com/Laravel-Toronto) - please message if you have a talk idea!), chowing down juicy pork buns and flavourful ramen at the [other David Chang's restaurant](https://noodlebar-toronto.momofuku.com/), reading at the local library or bookstore (which is always _en vogue_), and playing ping pong, tennis or the piano.

I'm also an editor for the [Gaardian](http://www.gaardian.com), a satirical newspaper for the [Aardwolf MUD](http://www.aardwolf.com) community. You can find me by the name `Mandorallen`.

Feel free to ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/davidchchang) or [GitHub](https://github.com/davidchchang) if you have a question! 

Thanks for dropping by!
